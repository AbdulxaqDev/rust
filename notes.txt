Let’s recap what we’ve learned so far about Cargo:

We can create a project using `cargo new`.
We can build a project using `cargo build`.
We can build and run a project in one step using `cargo run`.
We can build a project without producing a binary to check for errors using `cargo check`.
Instead of saving the result of the build in the same directory as our code, Cargo stores it in the `target/debug/` directory.

Building for Release
When your project is finally ready for release, you can use `cargo build --release` to compile it with optimizations. 
This command will create an executable in `target/release/` instead of `target/debug/`. The optimizations make 
your Rust code run faster, but turning them on lengthens the time it takes for your program to compile. This is why 
there are two different profiles: one for development, when you want to rebuild quickly and often, and another for building 
the final program you’ll give to a user that won’t be rebuilt repeatedly and that will run as fast as possible. 
If you’re benchmarking your code’s running time, be sure to run `cargo build --release` and benchmark with the executable 
in `target/release/`.

to include bult in library we need use `use` keyword as `#include` in c programmin language.

Cargo initializes git on new projects. It does not, if new project is created already in git.
To avoid git initialization, we can use --vcs flag.

We can add external crate to Cargo.toml file to use in projetc.
as rand:

rand = "0.8.5"

We can update used crates with 'cargo update'

By default, variables are immutable in rust, to make them mutable, the 'mut' keyword need to be used

let mut num = 7;

Can't be used variables created with 'let' in blobal scope, but with 'conts' can be.
The contant variables are always immutable, the type of value must be annotated and can be assigned to only 
constant expression, not to a value that can be calculates at runtime. And, uppercase is used for constants.

const NUM: i8 = 127;

We can shadow variables

let x = 5;
let x = x + 18;

last version of x will be used, this is shadowing.

mut vs shadowing

shadowed variable at the end stays immutable and its type can be changed while shadowing
with the same variable name.

let spaces = "    ";
let spaces = spaces.len();
